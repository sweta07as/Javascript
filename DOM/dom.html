<!-- DOM (Document Object Model) -->

<!-- HTML file is just a document like any other document i.e., PDF or Word file etc -->
<!-- DOM means you are creating a model for your document i.e., how it should be laid out -->
<!-- DOM is a pictorial representation of whatever you are doing in your html file i.e., how our document structure looks like -->
<!-- Helpful when you have to track down a particular element -->
